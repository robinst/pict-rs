# pict-rs 0.5.14

pict-rs is a simple image hosting microservice, designed to handle storing and retrieving images,
animations, and videos, as well as providing basic image processing functionality.

## Overview

pict-rs 0.5.14 includes a bugfix for identifying certain MOV videos, as well as updated dependencies.

### Fixes

- [Empty Stream Parsing](#empty-stream-parsing)


## Upgrade Notes

There are no significant changes from 0.5.13. Upgrading should be as simple as pulling a new version
of pict-rs.


## Descriptions

### Empty Stream Parsing

Certain videos, when identified with ffprobe, contain stream json objects with no fields. This would
cause pict-rs to fail to parse the information for these videos, as it expects streams to at least
contain a codec field. In pict-rs 0.5.14, empty streams are now considered valid and are simply
ignored.
