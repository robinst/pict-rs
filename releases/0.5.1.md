the public_endpoint configuration is now supported.

## Upgrade Notes

There's no significant changes from 0.5.0, so upgrading should be as simple as pulling a new version
of pict-rs.


## Descriptions

### Support Paths in PUBLIC_ENDPOINT

The `public_endpoint` configuration option for object storage has been updated to allow setting
paths at which the files are available. Previously any set path would be overridden, treating the
file's relative path as it's absolute path. Now pict-rs will serve files respecting configured
paths.

Example
```toml
public_endpoint = "https://example.com/sub/path"
```
This will produce URLs to `https://example.com/sub/path/$filepath`
