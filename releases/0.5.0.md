## Upgrade Notes

The upgrade from pict-rs 0.4 to 0.5 might take some time. Any uploads that have not had their
metadata extracted will be processed during this migration. In order to reduce the time required the
migration, pict-rs version 0.4.6 can be run first, and the `/internal/prepare_upgrade` endpoint can
be hit. This will tell pict-rs to extract the required metadata for the 0.5 upgrade in the
background while 0.4 is still running, enabling the upgrade to 0.5 to proceed much faster after it
completes. More information about this endpoint can be found in the
[0.4.6 release document](./0.4.6.md)

If you're running the provided docker container with default configuration values, the 0.5 container
can be pulled and launched with no changes. There is a migration from the 0.4 database format to the
0.5 database format that will occur automatically on first launch. This is also the process that
will extract metadata for any uploads that have not had their metadata extracted yet.

If you have any custom configuration, note that some media-related configuration values have been
moved. See [Media Configuration](#media-configuration) below.

pict-rs 0.5 now supports postgres for metadata storage. It is possible to upgrade directly from 0.4
to 0.5 with postgres, rather than upgrading to 0.5 with sled and then making the migration later.
This process is documented in the
[pict-rs readme](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#upgrading-directly-to-postgres).

A notable addition in 0.5 is upgrade configuration. Since the migration accesses media from the
configured store, increasing the concurrency can be beneficial. By default, pict-rs will attempt to
migrate 32 records at a time, but this value can be increased.

In the configuration file
```toml
[upgrade]
concurrency = 32
```

With environment variables
```bash
PICTRS__UPGRADE__CONCURRENCY=32
```

On the commandline
```bash
pict-rs run --upgrade-concurrency 32
```

More information can be found in the
[pict-rs 0.4 to 0.5 migration guide](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#04-to-05-migration-guide).


## Descriptions

### Postgres Repo

One of the most anticipated features of pict-rs 0.5 is the support for postgres for metadata
storage. This makes pict-rs (mostly) stateless, enabling it to be scaled horizontally across
multiple physical or virtual hosts. It also simplifies administration and backup processes for folks
who are already running a postgres server for other reasons.

Configuring postgres is simple. The `repo` section of the pict-rs configuration now supports more
than just `sled`.

In the configuration file
```toml
[repo]
type = 'postgres'
url = 'postgres://user:password@host:5432/db'
```

With environment variables
```bash
PICTRS__REPO__TYPE=postgres
PICTRS__REPO__URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/db
```

On the commandline
```bash
pict-rs run filesystem -p ./data postgres -u 'postgres://user:password@host:5432/db'
```

It is possible to update from 0.4 directly to 0.5 with postgres, this process is documented in the
[pict-rs readme](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#upgrading-directly-to-postgres).

It is possible to migrate to postgres after first upgrading to 0.5. This is also ducmented in the
[pict-rs readme](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#sled-to-postgres-migration).


### Media Proxy

pict-rs 0.5 supports caching media, and purging cached media after it is no longer necessary to
keep. This behavior is accessed with pict-rs' new `proxy` query parameter at the `/image/original`
endpoint, and the `/image/process.{ext}` endpoint. By passing the URL to an image to the `proxy`
parameter, you can instruct pict-rs to download the media from that URL and cache it locally before
serving it, or a processed version of it. The proxied media is stored for a configurable time limit,
which resets on each access to the proxied media.

This value can be configured as follows

In the configuration file
```toml
[media.retention]
proxy = "7d" # units available are "m" for minutes, "h" for hours, "d" for days, and "y" for years
```

With environment variables
```bash
PICTRS__MEDIA__RETENTION__PROXY=7d
```

On the commandline
```bash
pict-rs run --media-retention-proxy 7d
```

More documentation can be found in the [pict-rs readme](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#api)
and in the example [pict-rs.toml](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs/src/branch/main/pict-rs.toml).


### Improved Animation Support

pict-rs 0.4 only supported `gif` for animated images. This decision had been made due to the
format's poor support for higher-resolution animations with higher framerates compared to silent
videos for a given file size. In pict-rs 0.5, animated images are now supported to the same extent
as still images. Available formats for animated images include apng, avif, gif, and webp (although
not jxl yet).

With this support for more animated file types, pict-rs no longer transcodes larger animations into
videos. Instead, animated images will be left in their original format unless an override is
configured, and the default values for maximum animation dimensions, file size, and frame count have
been increased.

Configuration related to animations has been moved from `[media.gif]` to `[media.animation]` to
better reflect what it applies to.

For all configuration options regarding animations, see the example
[pict-rs.toml](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs/src/branch/main/pict-rs.toml).


### Media Configuration

pict-rs 0.5 splits media configuration further, allowing images, animations, and videos to each
specify their own maximum file size, dimensions, frame counts, etc, in addition to a few global
limits. Relevant sections of configuration are `[media]`, `[media.image]`, `[media.animation]`, and
`[media.video]`.

Note that although each media type now includes its own `MAX_FILE_SIZE` configuration, the
`PICTRS__MEDIA__MAX_FILE_SIZE` value still exists as a global limit for any file type.

In addition to all the configuration options mentioned above, there are now individual quality
settings that can be configured for each image and animation type, as well as for video files.
Please see the [pict-rs.toml](./pict-rs.toml) file for more information.

For all configuration options regarding media, see the example
[pict-rs.toml](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs/src/branch/main/pict-rs.toml).


### Improved Collision Resistance

Previously, pict-rs relied on a sha256 hash of uploaded media's bytes in order to detect which files
where the same, and which were unique. I have not heard of any existing problem with this behavior,
however, as pict-rs becomes more widely deployed I want to ensure that deduplication does not happen
erroneously. In the event of a hash collision between two different pieces of media, pict-rs would
consider them duplicates and discard the newly uploaded file in favor of the one it already stored.
This would lead to the wrong media being served for a user. In order to reduce the chances of a
collission, pict-rs 0.5 now includes the media's file length and a marker indicating it's content
type as part of it's unique identifier. This maintains the behavior of identical media being
deduplicated, while making collisions far less likely to occur.


### Optional Video Transcoding

In pict-rs 0.4, all videos that were uploaded were transcoded from their original format to either
pict-rs' default format, or a format specified with configuration. pict-rs 0.5 removes the default
"vp9" video codec, and allows uploaded videos to maintain their original codec and format, provided
pict-rs supports it. This means uploaded h264, h265, vp8, vp9, and av1 videos no longer need to be
decoded & encoded during the upload process aside from detecting their metadata.

This behavior is enabled by default, but for administrators who have configured a non-default video
codec, this can be enabled by removing the video_codec and audio_codec configurations.


### Library API Changes

The library API for pict-rs has changed from 0.4. It now follows a "fluent programming" pattern of
chaining methods to configure and launch the service from within another application. Documentation
for the new library API can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pict-rs)

For most cases, using pict-rs' `ConfigSource` as the entrypoint is recommended.

As a quick example,
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    pict_rs::ConfigSource::memory(serde_json::json!({
        "server": {
            "address": "127.0.0.1:8080"
        },
        "repo": {
            "type": "sled",
            "path": "./sled-repo"
        },
        "store": {
            "type": "filesystem",
            "path": "./files"
        }
    }))
    .init::<&str>(None)?
    .run_on_localset()
    .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```


### Reject Malformed Deadlines

pict-rs supports setting a request deadline with the `X-Request-Deadline` header, where the value is
a unix timestamp in nanoseconds. In pict-rs 0.4, requests with deadlines that could not be parsed
were treated as requests without deadlines. in pict-rs 0.5 a malformed deadline will cause the
request to be rejected with a 400 Bad Request error.
