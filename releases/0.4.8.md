# pict-rs 0.4.8

## Overview

This is a maintenance release. There's no meaningful changes outside of dependency upgrades and use
of the new CI system (Migrated from Drone to Forgejo Actions).

## Upgrade Notes

There's no significant changes from 0.4.7, so upgrading should be as simple as pulling a new version
of pict-rs.
